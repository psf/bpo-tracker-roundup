<!--
 This is the default body that is displayed when people visit the
 tracker. The tag below lists the currently open issues. You may
 replace it with a greeting message, or a different list of issues or
 whatever. It's a good idea to have the issues on the front page though
-->
<span tal:replace="structure python:db.issue.renderWith('index',
    sort=[('-', 'activity')], filter=['status'],
    columns=['activity','title','creator'],
    filterspec={'status':['1','2','4']})" />
